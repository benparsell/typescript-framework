# Typescript Framework

This repository contains the source code for a custom Typescript Framework, which was built as part of Stephen Grider's Typescript course. The framework is designed to provide scaffolding for creating custom models and views using Typescript.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Typescript Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory of the project.
3. Install parcel following your systems' recommending installation method via `yarn` or `npm`.
4. Run `parcel index.html` to start the Typescript compiler and watch for changes.
5. Start building your custom models and views using the Typescript Framework!

## Features

The Typescript Framework provides several features to help you build custom models and views:

- **Model layer**: The framework includes a model layer that provides a simple and intuitive way to define your data models using Typescript classes.
- **View layer**: The framework also includes a view layer that provides a powerful and flexible way to create custom views using Typescript classes and decorators.
- **Type safety**: Typescript provides static type checking, which helps to catch errors early and improve code quality.
- **Developer experience**: The Typescript Framework is designed to provide a great developer experience, with features like hot module reloading and a fast development cycle.
